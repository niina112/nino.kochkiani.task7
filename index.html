            <p class="content2">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="content4">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

                The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
